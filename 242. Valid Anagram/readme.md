You can view the problem on [LeetCode here](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/).

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return **true** if `t` is an **anagram** of `s`, and **false** otherwise.

An **anagram** is formed by rearranging the letters of a word using **all original letters exactly once**.

---

## Example 1

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true

**Explanation:**
Both strings contain the same characters with the same frequencies.

---

## Example 2

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false

**Explanation:**
The characters and their counts do not match.

---

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters only
